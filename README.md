# LeapReplica - Static demo site

This is a small static website scaffold inspired by leapmotor.net for demo and learning purposes.

Files:
- `index.html` - Homepage
- `products.html` - Product listing
- `about.html` - About page
- `contact.html` - Contact placeholder
- `css/style.css` - Styles
- `js/main.js` - Small interactivity
- `assets/` - Images (placeholders)

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site locally.

Notes:
- This is a static front-end only demo. No server-side or backend integration is included.
- Replace images in `assets/` with real photos for production.
